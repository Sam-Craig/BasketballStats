Introduction:

This project aims on building a scraper to automate retrieving data on NBA games and players from
basketball-reference.com, finding interesting statistical patterns based on player data, and build a machine learning
model that uses players season averages (per 36 minutes) for points, rebounds, assists, 2 point shots made (2pm), 2
point shots attempted (2pa), 3pm, 3pa, season minutes played, and minutes played during the game to predict the outcome
of the game, between 0 and 6, where 0 is a blowout for one team and 6 is a blowout for the other. This doesn't really
have practical implications, but it seems like an interesting application of machine learning which has a chance of
results.
